## File Structure

We use the component approach in our starter. This is the standard Angular2 propose for developing scalable application and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class. Here's how it looks:
```
